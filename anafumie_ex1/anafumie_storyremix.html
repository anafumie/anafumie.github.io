      <h2>Introduction to Story:</h2>
      <p>The year is 2068 the world is catastrophic, the zombie nation dominated
        the earth. After 2 years just few people still alive and walking like
        nomads to survive. Not only the virus was killing, but the human body
        couldn’t resist to the fear, angry and hungry.<br>
        My survivor group finally had all the technology to fix a time machine
        to send me when everything started and try to save the human future.
        The only problem is I will have only one week in the past to do it.<br>
        Now I’m in San Francisco and the year is 2066, I have all the research
        and hope in my hands.

      <h3>Story Ending One</h3>
      <p>I needed to do was to get in the company that created the virus, give
        them the research and make them create a vaccine. So when I got there
        they treat me very well, the whole week we worked together. I gave them
        all the knowledge that I had.<br>
        I was finally going back to 2068, hoping that the world was normal again
        But when I got there everything was the same. And them I just realized
        they used me, I was the one that gave them information to spread the
        virus.</p>

      <h3>Story Ending Two</h3>
      <p>I needed to do was to get in the company that created the virus, give
        them the research and make them create a vaccine. So when I got there
        it felt like they were already waiting for me. As soon as I step on the
        company the security came and arrest me, stole my research. I was their
        prisoner for the entire week.<br>
        My time was almost gone so they inject the virus on me. When I got in
        2068 I was already one of them. </p>
